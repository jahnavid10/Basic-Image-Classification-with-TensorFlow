# Basic-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
I have used MNIST dataset to create, train and evaluate neural network models with TensorFlow and Keras where I created a neural network model which will be able to classify images of hand written digits with a high degree of accuracy.
Following tasks have been carried out in this:
1. Importing the MNIST dataset.
2. Encoding the labels from the dataset.
3. Graphical representation of linear equations.
4. Unrolling the input features.
5. Data normalization with mean and standard deviation.
6. Creating a sequential model with Keras.
7. Compiling the model by specifying an optimizer and a loss function.
8. Training the model to fit to training data.
9. Evaluating the model on the test data.
10. Predictions on the test set.
11. Visualizing the predictions.
